Does Sydney Sweeney have tattoos?
No I do not. I have the biggest phobia of needles...like the biggest. I have to be held down to get my blood drawn or get a shot...I don't know what happened when I was young...but I tried everything...I've tried therapy...hypnotism...laughing gas...nothing works...and it's something I'm trying to get better on but...yeah, I don't have tattoos...because of that.
